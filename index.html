                        <b>Donald J Trump</b>, president of the United States of America from 2017 - 2021, had a long standing and controversial stint on the social media platform Twitter before and all throughout his presidency. Accused of supporting the far-right due to his actions of refusing to condemn white supremacists (such as David Duke and the KKK) and retweeting posts from accounts born with racist intent, he strayed far from what one might deem to be politically correct. 
                        <br><br>
                        This as well as a myriad of other acts of disrespect of Twitter‚Äôs terms of service resulted in him being banned from the platform on the 8th of January 2021 after multiple warnings. The company cited their ‚ÄòPublic Interest Framework‚Äô and accused the former president of inciting violence shortly after it was announced that he would not be returning to the oval office for a second term. As a result of this Washington D.C saw unprecedented riots in support of Trump all while he was claiming that the election had been stolen from him whilst citing discredited sources that have been condemned by news outlets as well as federal and state courts. These riots resulted in the storming of the White House and the evacuation of the US House of Representatives and the Senate, reminiscent of a terrorist level threat.

                        <b>Reddit</b> is a social media platform which is used to distribute all forms of content in small communities known as ‚Äòsubreddits‚Äô. Users join subreddits that are generally specific to a single topic such as r/cars or r/technology. They will post and receive ‚Äòupvotes‚Äô (+1) or ‚Äòdownvotes‚Äô (-1) from other users on the platform and this gauges the popularity of the content in question.

                        In the case of this case study, due to the fact that the tweets have been deleted as a result of Donald Trump being banned, I analysed the statistics of said tweets when posted on Reddit due to their permalinks still existing. The data takes into account the amount of times it was posted on Reddit and the average score it received across these posts. Examples of such posts include news related subreddits to subreddits that support Trump (excluding r/DonaldTrump, banned Jan 2021) to subreddits run by bots that simply posted his tweets whenever a new one was made. The search was made across almost 17,000 tweets and mapped against the precalculated ‚Äòsentiment‚Äô value which ranges from -1 (low sentiment/negative connotations) to 1 (vice-versa).
