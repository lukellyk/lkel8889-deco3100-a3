                        <b>Donald J Trump</b>, president of the United States of America from 2017 - 2021, had a long standing and controversial stint on the social media platform Twitter before and all throughout his presidency. Accused of supporting the far-right due to his actions of refusing to condemn white supremacists (such as David Duke and the KKK) and retweeting posts from accounts born with racist intent, he strayed far from what one might deem to be politically correct. 
                        <br><br>
                        This as well as a myriad of other acts of disrespect of Twitter’s terms of service resulted in him being banned from the platform on the 8th of January 2021 after multiple warnings. The company cited their ‘Public Interest Framework’ and accused the former president of inciting violence shortly after it was announced that he would not be returning to the oval office for a second term. As a result of this Washington D.C saw unprecedented riots in support of Trump all while he was claiming that the election had been stolen from him whilst citing discredited sources that have been condemned by news outlets as well as federal and state courts. These riots resulted in the storming of the White House and the evacuation of the US House of Representatives and the Senate, reminiscent of a terrorist level threat.

                        <b>Reddit</b> is a social media platform which is used to distribute all forms of content in small communities known as ‘subreddits’. Users join subreddits that are generally specific to a single topic such as r/cars or r/technology. They will post and receive ‘upvotes’ (+1) or ‘downvotes’ (-1) from other users on the platform and this gauges the popularity of the content in question.
                        <br><br>
                        In the case of this case study, due to the fact that the tweets have been deleted as a result of Donald Trump being banned, I analysed the statistics of said tweets when posted on Reddit due to their permalinks still existing. The data takes into account the amount of times it was posted on Reddit and the average score it received across these posts. Examples of such posts include news related subreddits to subreddits that support Trump (excluding r/DonaldTrump, banned Jan 2021) to subreddits run by bots that simply posted his tweets whenever a new one was made. The search was made across almost 17,000 tweets and mapped against the precalculated ‘sentiment’ value which ranges from -1 (low sentiment/negative connotations) to 1 (vice-versa).

                </div>
                <div class="break"></div>
                <div class="inner-flex-item" style="background-color: #A8DADC; display: table;">

                </div>
                <div class="inner-flex-item" style="background-color: #E63946;">
                    <p>The data, which compares the pre-calculated sentiment of the tweet to the average score the tweet received when posted across Reddit shows that there is no clear correlation between the two factors. 
                    <br><br>
                    This paints a picture to show that no matter what the sentiment or the intention of the tweet was, it became a matter of conversation for the general public and was hence shared to Reddit in order for a conversation to take place on the various subreddits. Anthropologists concluded early on that the popularity and conversation-starting nature of Trump’s tweets could be attributed to the fact that he ‘always seems ahead of everyone else in framing the message (in the informational sense)’ [Caton & Stolee, 2018]. While other public figures took time to carefully craft politically correct and factually-based messages for their constituents, Trump took the stance that quickly conveying information in a short form was the best way to tackle these situations. This is made obvious through frequent selling and grammatical errors and the often spreading of inaccurate or just wrong information, often in times when a concise and accurate message would’ve been much more effective.
                    <br><br>
                    These chaotic tweets were received well by his far-right supporters and debated fiercely by those who didn’t believe he was fit for the job. Reddit provided a perfect base of operations for these conversations to take place. While his supporters could rally around him and discuss their positive views on his posts, conversely, their respective opponents could tear apart the tweet with reasons why they didn’t agree with it or why it was inaccurate, creating very strong echo chambers. It was through the combination of these echo chambers in subreddits such as r/politics that Reddit was truly characterised. Trump’s tweets would be posted and this would spark fierce debate about the topic often devolving into childish arguments before moderators would be forced to take action and archive or delete threads in order to manage the virtual riots, a poetic foreshadowing for what was to come in reality at the end of the Trump presidency.</p>

                <div class="inner-flex-item" style="background-color: #457B9D;">
                    <p>Trump’s stint as the president of the United States was a very public one, landing him in the public eye and headlines almost every single day. This fact is represented by this graph. His tweets were regularly being posted to reddit and discussed with hundreds of points garnered very often. This is a very stark contrast to his predecessor, Barack Obama. Upon analysing Reddit data with regard to his tweets I was faced with basically no data. Threads were not created with regard to his tweets and the platform remained somewhat silent on the topic. 
                    <br><br>
                    This also brings about evidence with regard to Trump’s sheer saturation of social media from his personal account. During his presidency Obama semi-regularly used Twitter in a professional sense, promoting his policies and supporting causes that pleased the vast majority, seemingly not just because it was what the people wanted but because it was what he honestly believed in. Obama consistently received a higher retweet-to-reply ratio than Donald Trump. These results suggesting that  Trump’s Twitter posts are more often controversial and subject to enduring engagement as a given news cycle unfolds (Minot, Arnold, Alshaabi, Danforth, & Dodds, 2021).
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, it can be seen that the existence of this constant support, opposition and tension with regards to the President is a cross section of society during his term. It opened up the floor on Reddit for these debates between left and right wing supporters to fight for whatever opinion they believed to be correct, with many of them reaching the ‘front page’ (most popular posts for that day across Reddit) of the site, attracting more and more participants in a exponential increase until the next topic came across for debate.</p>

                    <p>
                        When comparing the average Reddit scores for <b>Joe Biden</b> and <b>Donald Trump</b> in the <u>first 100 days</u> of their respective presidencies it is clear who made their mark as a controversial leader early on.
                        <br><br>
                        Trump was quick to snap into action and announce reforms to legislation such as dumping the recently instituted ‘Obamacare’ and this caused controversy surrounding access to affordable healthcare, a major friction point in American society when compared to their allies such as Canada and Australia. Discussion on Reddit surrounding Trump’s tweets about the subject was rife with opposition as well as support for his bold move, one that he had promised all through his electoral campaign. 
                        <br><br>
                        This is contrasted heavily when compared to the recently elected President Biden. Data had to be collected from the @POTUS twitter account due to the fact that Biden’s personal tweets were receiving little to no attention due to him tweeting mainly from the official account and retweeting it on his personal account. First, it was nearly 20 days after his inauguration that Biden made any appearance on the account and he remained conservative in his posts posting nothing that was overly controversial, an ongoing theme to date. Biden’s semi-regular use of the platform, shown by the small rises and falls in the data show that he is less trigger happy and reliant on Twitter as a means of voicing his opinions, instead favouring official channels of communications such as press releases/conferences as well as addressing Congress.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, the difference in notoriety of the two US leaders is clear and their communication methods as well as overall character is made obvious by the extent at which their constituents feel the need to discuss their informal communications in the form of their tweets on Reddit. However, the data does not reveal whether this is a result of a lack of need to during their being any real change during the first 100 days of the Biden term or whether it reflects the characteristics of their voters.
